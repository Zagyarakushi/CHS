# Cheap Home Security

This is a project to use smartphones, tablets, IP cameras, computers, raspberry pis and any other thing that has a camera and allows you to stream the feed as a security camera with motion detection.

Once a motion is detected, an email will be sent with the image and video.

This project will use FOSS as much as possible.

# Things that have been done

- Alert script.  
- Streaming the feed (Using Spynet Cam application on Android).

- 24/7 recording on a NAS with automatic deletion of video after storage starts getting filled up.  
- Maybe automatic setup and configuration with a nice program.
